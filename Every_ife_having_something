My baby girl, can you see me down here?
I know I may look like I'm drowning,
but somehow I got through this year
Tash wipe away all your tears
No girl, don't be worried, remember you taught me 
To live without fear

And you believed in me when I didn't believe it
Night after night you telling me I could make it
We traveled the world, never separated
I'm still lost without you

And every night when I turn out the lights 
I see you shining somewhere in the dark
But tell me why you can't  just spend one night, babe, 
Down here in my arms for one last time?
One last time. One last time.
One last time. One last time.
One last time.

Now I'm closing my eyes, take me back in time
To the first time we kissed at that bus stop in Hammersmith , Route no 9.
And I'm so glad that I could make you my wife,
I'll always remember the feeling when I saw you walked down that aisle
Ooh oh oh

And you believed in me when I didn't believe it
Night after night, telling me I could make it
We traveled the world, never separated
I used to fall asleep in your arms
When I was lost, girl, you gave me focus
You gave me strength when I was at my lowest 
I gave you everything I had, hope you know that
And I want the whole world to know it

That every night when I turn out the lights 
I see you shining somewhere in the dark
But tell me why I didn't get to say goodbye
Or just hold you in my arms for one last time?
One last time. One last time.
One last time. One last time.

And with your final breathe, you called out my name
You left me behind, but I know that we'll meet again
So, Tash if you hear me
I promise I'll keep on singing
I promise I'll keep believing 
Cause I still feel your spirit

And every night when I turn out the lights 
I see you shining somewhere in the dark
And tell me why you can't you just spend one night, babe, 
Down here in my arms just for one last time?
One last time. One last time.
One last time. One last time.
One last time.
